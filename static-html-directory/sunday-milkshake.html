<p>A sweet and refreshing milkshake that barely requires any effort to make. You&rsquo;re
not required to make it and drink it on Sunday, it was just almost a tradition
in my family to make it on the weekends, and it somehow does taste better on a
Saturday or Sunday morning.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>These are for about 4 glasses or 1 liter:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 banana (or 2 if they are small)</li>
<li>~120 grams of berries. Can be any berries you like.</li>
<li>&lt;1 liter of milk</li>
<li>Vanilla</li>
<li>Sugar</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Chop the banana so that it fits better in the blender.</li>
<li>Add the banana pieces, berries, vanilla and sugar to taste to the blender.
Usually I use about 6 tea spoons of sugar.</li>
<li>Pour enough milk so that the mix fills a liter of the blender volume.</li>
<li>Blend it until the mix looks somewhat homogeneous.</li>
<li>Pour it and enjoy!</li>
</ol>


<p>Basically anything is better consumed fresh, but it is especially the case for
this milkshake recipe. If you leave it sitting for more than 10-15 minutes it
won&rsquo;t be so delicious anymore.</p>
