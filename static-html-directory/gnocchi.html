<p>Gnocchi is a pasta based on potato, making it a less bloating alternative to other kinds of pasta.
They are substantial and can be roasted in butter and other ingredients.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>potatoes</li>
<li>flour</li>
<li>tomato</li>
<li>parmesan</li>
<li>butter</li>
<li>sage or oregano or thyme</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Boil potatoes (with their skins) until mashable.</li>
<li>Slice potatoes in two and scoop them out of their skin.</li>
<li>Mash with a potato-masher while adding kosher salt.</li>
<li>Slowly begin to add flour while mashing and kneading until there are no lumps of potato and the potato/flour mixture takes on a dough-like consistency.</li>
<li>Begin to boil more water with lots of kosher salt added.</li>
<li>Flour a work surface, pinch off some of the dough and roll it on the surface into a long chubby snake.</li>
<li>Slice the dough snake into small pieces. Press the pieces with your finger to make an indentation.</li>
<li>Add the pieces to the boiling water. They will rise to the top when they are ready.</li>
<li>In a pan, melt butter and add sprigs of sage (oregano or thyme will work as well, albeit are less traditional). Smashed tomato juices are also a nice addition.</li>
<li>Add the cooked gnocchi to the pan and roast them in butter for a minute or two until slightly browned. As pan begins to dry, add some pasta water.</li>
<li>Serve gnocchi on a plate, grate on Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese liberally. Add garnish if desired.</li>
</ol>
