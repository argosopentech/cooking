<p>Rice is easy to make in any pot.
The simple use of different spices can change its use or what it accents.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>rice</li>
<li><a href="chicken-stock-bone-broth.html">chicken stock</a> (optional)</li>
<li>onion or garlic (optional)</li>
<li>lime and cilantro (optional, for a Mexican taste)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Add some amount of rice to a pot that has a cover.</li>
<li>Add twice as much liquid to the same pot. Water is typical, but for extra flavor, use stock or broth.</li>
<li>If desired, dice onion or garlic and mix into rice.</li>
<li>Cover the pot, put it on the stove and turn the heat on the highest level.</li>
<li>As soon as you hear the water beginning to bubble and boil over, turn the heat down to low and allow it to simmer.</li>
<li>Wait for twenty minutes or so until the liquid has evaporated and the rice will be ready.</li>
</ol>


<h3>For Mexican rice</h3>

<p>For Mexican rice, you might want to avoid cooking in stock to avoid taste clashes.</p>

<ol>
<li>Dice up some cilantro.</li>
<li>Mix in cilantro to finished rice, along with some squeezes of lime juice.</li>
</ol>
