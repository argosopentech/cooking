<p>A swiss favorite, <em>Älplermagronen</em> combines pretty much everything you have at your disposal in your alpine chalet.
It&rsquo;s the definition of comfort food for the Swiss.</p>

<p>Serves 5-6.</p>

<p>Cooking time: ~30 minutes</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>~150g (1/3 lb) bacon cubes</li>
<li>3 onions (medium size)</li>
<li>400g (15 oz) potatoes (firm/waxy)</li>
<li>2L (&frac12; gal) milk</li>
<li>200g (7oz) macaroni (dry weight)</li>
<li>~150g (1/3 lb) medium soft cheese. Appenzeller works best. Gruyère would be my go-to alternative.</li>
<li>a jar of apple sauce</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Fry bacon cubes in pot (this pot will be used for everything so choose an appropriately large one).</li>
<li>Cut onions into half-rings and let them sweat in the same pot. Add some butter if your bacon was not fatty enough.</li>
<li>Peel potatoes and cut them into ~1 cm/half inch cubes.</li>
<li>When the onions have become sufficiently cooked, add potatoes.</li>
<li>Top everything with milk and let the potatoes cook for about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Add macaroni and the remaining milk to cover everything. Most of the milk will be absorbed by the macaroni.</li>
<li>Shred your cheese.</li>
<li>A minute or two before the macaroni are done, add the shredded cheese into the pot. It should appear a bit too runny in the pot. While cooling it will increase in viscosity quite a bit. If the final texture is not creamy enough, it is most likely due to using the wrong cheese.</li>
<li>Season to taste. (Needs quite a bit of salt). Nutmeg also works well here.</li>
<li>Serve with apple sauce. Should be eaten together, not as a dessert.</li>
</ol>
