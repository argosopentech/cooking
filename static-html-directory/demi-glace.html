<p>This is a take on a traditional demi-glace without needing to buy an astronomically large amount of veal bones. Use this as your main base for pan sauces, an extra flavor bomb, or a replacement for recipes that call for broth or stock.</p>

<p>These are the basic proportions â€” multiply as needed. I typically multiply by six to give me several weeks worth of demi-glace ice cubes.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 qt (32 oz, 946mL) <strong>low-sodium</strong> broth or stock (I prefer Pacific Foods)</li>
<li>1 &frac14; oz (7g) packet <strong>unflavored, unsweetened</strong> gelatin</li>
<li>1 teaspoon (5mL) tomato paste</li>
<li>1 teaspoon (5mL) <strong>low-sodium</strong> soy sauce</li>
<li>&frac12; teaspoon onion powder (<em>very</em> optional)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Put the tomato paste in a large pot, <em>then</em> turn the heat on medium</li>
<li>Spread the paste around the bottom of the pot and stir until it just barely starts to brown</li>
<li>Deglaze with the broth</li>
<li>Stir in all other ingredients and boil over high heat until reduced to about 1/6th of its original volume</li>
<li>Freeze in ice cub trays</li>
</ol>
