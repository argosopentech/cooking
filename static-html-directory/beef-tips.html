<p>Tender chunks of meat in a rich brown gravy poured over sour cream mashed potatoes, made in a pressure cooker. This recipe is a modification of the <a href="https://youtu.be/91gAm1hBaT4">Texas Cafe Classics Sirloin Tips Recipe</a> by Mark Rippetoe.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>Any lean, tough cut of meat (ex. round steak)</li>
<li>Unprocessed animal fat of some kind (ex. beef suet, mutton fat)</li>
<li>Potatoes</li>
<li>Sour cream</li>
<li>Butter</li>
<li>Milk</li>
<li>Shredded cheese of your choice</li>
<li>Small amount of flour</li>
<li>Beef bouillon (optional)</li>
<li>Red wine (optional)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<p><strong>Beef Tips in Gravy</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Throw your pressure cooker with an open lid onto high heat or turn it onto saute mode if it&rsquo;s electric</li>
<li>Chop up the fat into very small, uniform cubes or strips and begin to saute it in the pressure cooker</li>
<li>Chop up your meat into medium, uniform cubes or strips and add it to the fat</li>
<li><em>Optional</em>: If you are not using red wine as a deglaze in step 7 or are not cooking a large amount (~2+ pounds/~1+ kg) of meat, you may want to add a teaspoon or so of beef bouillon into the pressure cooker to intensify the beef flavor of the gravy</li>
<li>Add a generous amount of salt and pepper to taste along with a tiny pinch of garlic powder and stir (be very conservative with the garlic powder)</li>
<li>Once the meat is sufficiently browned off and there is a nice glaze forming on the bottom of the cooker, deglaze the cooker using hot water or red wine (optional) for more flavor.</li>
<li>Put the top on your pressure cooker and allow the meat to cook for around 30 minutes on low heat while you prepare your mashed potatoes</li>
<li>After half an hour, vent your pressure cooker, remove the lid, and put the cooker back on low heat</li>
<li>Add a small amount of hot water until the liquid in the cooker is a bit more than the amount of gravy you want, then allow it to come to a boil</li>
<li>In a small bowl, mix up some flour with warm water to the consistency of a very runny batter</li>
<li>Very slowly begin adding flour water into the pot while constantly stirring until the gravy thickens and reaches the consistency you desire (it&rsquo;s very easy to overthicken the gravy here, don&rsquo;t overdo it!)</li>
<li>Turn off the heat and plate on top of your sour cream mashed potatoes, shown below</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Peel and dice up your potatoes</li>
<li>Boil them on medium heat in a pot of slightly salty water until they begin to fall apart when poked with a fork</li>
<li>Turn off the heat and pour off the water</li>
<li>Mash up the potatoes to the chunkiness you desire</li>
<li>While the potatoes are still warm, add a generous amount of butter and shredded cheese and stir</li>
<li>Add a very small amount of milk and stir (be conservative here, the sour cream will provide most of the softness of the mash)</li>
<li>Begin adding sour cream and thoroughly mixing until the mash reaches your desired consistency</li>
<li>Plate under your beef tips in gravy</li>
</ol>
