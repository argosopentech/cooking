<p>Very filling egg dish that&rsquo;s easy, fast, and can be eaten at any meal. Any other types of vegetables can be added, this is just what I use the most</p>

<ul>
<li>‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 10 min</li>
<li>üç≥ Cook time: 30 min</li>
<li>üçΩÔ∏è Servings:4-6</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>4-6 Eggs</li>
<li>&frac12; Onion</li>
<li>1 Bell Pepper</li>
<li>2 Tbsp Heavy Cream</li>
<li>Thinly sliced meat (prosciutto, shaved chicken, sandwich steak, etc.) (Optional)</li>
<li>Shredded cheese of choice (Optional)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Dice peppers and onions and saute in an oven safe pan at medium heat.</li>
<li>Add in meat to the pan and set oven to low broil.</li>
<li>Beat eggs, cream, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.</li>
<li>Add in egg mixture to the pan and mix together until even.</li>
<li>Cook egg and vegetable mixture in pan until eggs begin to firm up and edges begin to pull away. Place into oven</li>
<li>Keep in Oven until completely firm. At this point you can add shredded cheese on top and put back into the oven until melted (about 2 more minutes)</li>
<li>Flip out of pan and cool to room temperature to ensure settling.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Other good vegetables include spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, broccoli rabe</li>
<li>If adding tomatoes, try to keep as much of the juice out to prevent it from being too watery and falling apart</li>
<li>An easy way to get it out of the pan is flip upside down on to a plate and then flip again onto another plate/cooling rack</li>
<li>It is possible to use ground meat as well, but it may have to cook a bit longer in the over to ensure firmness.</li>
</ul>
