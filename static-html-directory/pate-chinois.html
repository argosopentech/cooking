<p><img src="pix/pate-chinois.webp" title="Homemade pate chinois with to much ketchup" alt="pate chinois" /></p>

<p>This is the most traditional dish that every household eats in Quebec. As a kid, you would eat P√¢t√© Chinois at least once a week, either at home or at the school&rsquo;s cafeteria,. It is very similar to a Shepherd‚Äôs Pie, as it is divided in 3 layers of ingredients: meat, legumes and mashed potatoes. The literal translation of the name is something like <em>chinese pie</em>. You can search for the origin of the name on the internet, I&rsquo;m not an history teacher.</p>
