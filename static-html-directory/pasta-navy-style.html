<p>This is one of the three pasta dishes that I usually cook. It&rsquo;s a Russian pasta
recipe that is fast and easy to make and is quite tasty.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>Here are the ingredients for about two hearty adult portions:</p>

<ul>
<li>250g pasta. Usually I prefer to use fusilli or penne, but any short-cut pasta
should do.</li>
<li>300-400g ground beef</li>
<li>3-4 tomatoes</li>
<li>1 carrot</li>
<li>&frac12; onion</li>
<li>2-3 garlic cloves</li>
<li>Cumin</li>
<li>Paprika</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Add olive oil to your frying pan, heat it to medium-high heat.</li>
<li>Chop some onions and add them to the preheated pan.</li>
<li>After a couple of minutes add the ground beef to the pan, salt it and mix it
a bit with the onions in the pan.</li>
<li>When the meat is almost done, mince the garlic and add it together with the
cumin and paprika to the pan.</li>
<li><a href="pasta.html">Cook the pasta</a> in a pot until its done al dente while the beef is being
cooked.</li>
<li>Grate the tomatoes over the pan using a grater with small-sized slots, in
such a way that the tomato paste and juice falls right away from the grater
to the pan.</li>
<li>Grate the carrot using a grater with medium-sized slots and add it to the
pan.</li>
<li>Salt some more to taste, and add some black pepper to taste, mix.</li>
<li>Cook it over medium/medium-low heat for about 10-15 minutes or until the
water and juices from the tomatoes have almost completely evaporated.</li>
<li>Once (or if) the pasta and beef is already cooked, add the pasta to the pan
and cook for another couple of minutes.</li>
<li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
