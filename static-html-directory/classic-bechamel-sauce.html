<li>Once the butter is fully melted add the flour and stir it in to make a roux.</li>
<li>Keep stiring your roux on medium low heat until it gets lightly golden brown and starts melling a bit nutty.</li>
<li>Add about a glass of your whole milk and stir until combined, repeat this process until you have a thick sauce in your pan and new milk you add easily combines. Never stop stirring.</li>
<li>At this point you can add the rest of your milk, if you skip the previous step you will end up with lumps of roux that are hard to get out.</li>
<li>Lower your heat to low and keep stiring don&rsquo;t forget to get in the corners of the pot because your sauce will burn easily.</li>
<li>Once your sauce has the desired thickness give it a taste and add your salt and pepper until it is to your liking. A pinch of nutmeg, preferably freshly grated, will also go a long way.</li>
