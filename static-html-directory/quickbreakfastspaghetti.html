<p>A quick breakfast spaghetti recipe that covers a healthy amount of carbs, fat, and spices. Eggs
and/or bacon can be added to cover some protein, you should cook those while the boiler is cooking
the spaghetti for time efficiency.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>Spaghetti (any kind you prefer)</li>
<li>Ground spices (I like to use cumin, tumeric, paprika, and garlic)</li>
<li>Tomato Paste/Sauce (preferably one with basil and without preservative)</li>
<li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Boil some water fully and prepare a pot.</li>
<li>While the water is boiling, add all your spices in the pot with the spaghetti on top.</li>
<li>Pour the boiled water on the spaghetti to make it soft so you can immerse it fully in the water.</li>
<li>Mix thoroughly the water with the spices and salt and pepper if needed.</li>
<li>Place the pot on the stove, keep it boiling, and stir every minute or two for 8 minutes.</li>
<li>It should take no more than 8 minutes, but you can check if it is fully cooked by tasting one piece at a time.</li>
<li>Once it is fully cooked, strain the water from the pot and keep the spaghetti in.</li>
<li>Before placing it back on the stove, add and mix a generous amount of olive oil. Now&rsquo;s the time to add bacon or turkey if you are also using that.</li>
<li>While stirring the spaghetti, add your tomato sauce or paste and keep mixing for a minute and avoid letting it stick to the boiler.</li>
<li>Pour the spaghetti out in your favorite bowl and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
