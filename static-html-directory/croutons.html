<p>Croutons are an essential addition to many salads.  They are delicious and easy to make at home.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>Hearty White Bread</li>
<li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
<li>Spices</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  Gently cut slices of white bread into squares with a chef&rsquo;s knife.  One to two slices is usually enough for one person.</li>
<li>In a large bowl combine olive oil, spices, and bread squares and gently mix to thoroughly season bread.  Spices can be anything but I recommend oregano, paprika, black pepper, garlic powder or freshly minced garlic, and a small pinch of cayenne.</li>
<li>Spread seasoned bread squares large face down onto a baking sheet evenly and put in oven for 6-8 minutes.  Once the bread has crisped flip each square and put back in oven for another 6-8 minutes or until crispy throughout.</li>
<li>Once fully baked, let rest until cool.  These can be eaten immediately or saved in a sandwich bag for later.</li>
</ol>
