<p>Sauerkraut is a based lacto-fermented food that is healthy and has a long shelf live.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 head of cabbage</li>
<li>2-4% sea salt by cabbage weight</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Prepare and clean as many glass jars as you think you&rsquo;ll need.</li>
<li>Chop or shred cabbage and rinse under cold water. Sprinkle with salt.</li>
<li>Knead the cabbage with clean hands for about 10 minutes until there is enough liquid to cover it.</li>
<li>Stuff the cabbage into a glass jar, pressing the cabbage underneath the liquid. If necessary, add a bit of water to completely cover the cabbage.</li>
<li>Cover the jar with a tight lid, airlock lid, or coffee filter secured with a rubber band.</li>
<li>Culture at room temperature (60-70°F/15-20°C is preferred) for at least 2 weeks, until desired flavor and texture is achieved. If using a tight lid, burp it daily to release excess pressure.</li>
<li>Once the sauerkraut is finished, put a tight lid on the jar and move to cold storage. The sauerkraut&rsquo;s flavor will continue to develop as it ages.</li>
</ol>
