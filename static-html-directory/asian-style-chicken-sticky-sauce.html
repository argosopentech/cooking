<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<h3>Chicken with crispy coating</h3>

<ul>
<li>Around 14 ounces or 400 grams of chicken breast</li>
<li>1 Egg</li>
<li>3 tbsp of cornflour</li>
<li>10 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
<li>&frac12; tsp garlic powder</li>
<li>2 tsp paprika powder</li>
<li>Around 5 tbsp of vegetable oil for frying the chicken</li>
</ul>


<h3>Sauce</h3>

<ul>
<li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, mashed to paste.</li>
<li>1 tbsp Chinese rice vinegar or alternatively white wine vinegar</li>
<li>3 tbsp honey</li>
<li>2 tbsp ketchup</li>
<li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
<li>4 tbsp soy sauce</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Prepare the sauce by mixing the indgredients together in a bowl.</li>
<li>Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces.</li>
<li>Place all-purpose flour in a shallow bowl. Mix in garlic powder as well as salt and pepper, &frac12; tsp each.</li>
<li>Place lightly beaten egg in another shallow bowl.</li>
<li>Coat the chicken in corn flour, dip it in egg and finally coat with seasoned all purpose-flour.</li>
<li>Heat a good amount of oil on a pan to fry the chicken in. The oil should be hot enough so that the chicken sizzles when placed in the pan. You may want to do this in a couple of batches depending on the size of your pan.</li>
<li>Fry until chicken is cooked and has a nice golden-brownish coating.</li>
<li>Pour out excess oil, put the sauce in and mix to coat the chicken. Or place the chicken in a bowl with kitchen towels and do another batch.</li>
<li>Let the sauce bubble for one or two minutes and you&rsquo;re done.</li>
<li>Serve with boiled rice.</li>
