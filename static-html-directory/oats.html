<p>Oats are great for breakfast. On their own they&rsquo;re pretty bland, but become
great when you add some things to the bowl. This recipe offers some suggestions
on what to add, but is by no means a comprehensive overview of what you can do
with oats.</p>

<p>We cover both rolled and steel cut oats. Instant need not apply.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>oats</li>
<li>water</li>
<li>pinch of salt</li>
</ul>


<p>Pick and choose additional ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>chopped banana</li>
<li>any berries</li>
<li>cinnamon</li>
<li>peanut butter</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Bring water (with pinch of salt) to boil.</li>
<li>Add oats. Use a 2:1 water-to-oats ratio (by volume) for rolled oats, 3:1 for
steel cut.</li>
<li>Boil on medium heat until most of the water has been absorbed/evaporated.
Rolled oats will be ready quicker than steel cut.</li>
<li>Pour over fruit in bowl (if having fruit).</li>
<li>Sprinkle cinnamon (if having cinnamon).</li>
<li>Mix.</li>
<li>Add a spoonful of peanut butter (if having peanut butter).</li>
</ol>


<h2>Serving sizes</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need less dry steel cut oats versus rolled oats for the same serving
size. My personal &ldquo;standard serving&rdquo; is 1/3 cup steel cut or &frac12; cup rolled
(note that, per the ratios above, both of these end up needing 1 cup water).</p>
