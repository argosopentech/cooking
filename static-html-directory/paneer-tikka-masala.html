<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>250g cubes paneer</li>
<li>1 onion</li>
<li>1 capsicum</li>

<li>Preheat the oven to 200°C (392°F), and place the marinated paneer cubes, with onion, capsicum, and tomato on the skewers. Let them grill in the oven using skewer support, by continuously flipping them every 5 minutes until the outer crust looks crispy enough.</li>
<li>Start heating some oil in a pan to add some cardamom and cumin seeds. Let it heat until the flavour is transfused for about a minute or two.</li>
<li>Now add chopped onions and tomatoes to the sautee. Add some shaved ginger and garlic paste and let it sauté until some raw flavour disappears.</li>
<li>Add the tomato purée, dry fenugreek leaves, and let it cook for about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>As the spice and tomato purée looks cooked, add some water to the mixture and let it cook more.

<li>Now add the grilled paneer, some chopped vegetables of choice, corn and stir the mixture well.</li>
<li>One the added water seems to be evaporated, and the mixture looks a little thicker, turn off the heat and garnish with lemon juice, fresh coriander. (It can be served with bread of any preference.)</li>
