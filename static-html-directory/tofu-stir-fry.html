<p>A vegetarian dish that is easy to make and very flavorful. Goes well with rice or noodles</p>

<p>Serves 3 to 5.</p>

<p>Cooking time: ~10 to 20 minutes</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>One block of extra firm tofu</li>
<li>Three eggs</li>
<li>Vegetables per your choice, recommendations include:

<ul>
<li>Sugar snap peas</li>
<li>Chopped cabbage</li>
<li>Sliced carrots</li>
<li>Broccoli</li>
<li>Cauliflower</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Soy or teriyaki sauce</li>
<li>2 tbsp minced garlic</li>
<li>Coconut oil</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>(Optional) Deep freeze tofu at least 24 hours prior and then thaw. The freezing will crystalize the water inside and make the tofu spongey, giving it a more chewy texture, and aids in flavor absorption.</li>
<li>Chop tofu into cubes or slabs per preference and carefully drain water.</li>
<li>Allow tofu to soak in sauce for a few minutes.</li>
<li>Pour cooking oil into a copper wok evenly to coat around the basin. Let it fill up about half an inch at the bottom.</li>
<li>Heat oil at medium and place tofu, sauce, and minced garlic into pan. Adding sauce and herbs early helps tofu absorb the flavors.</li>
<li>Shift and flip the tofu around, gradually turning up the heat as you go, until surface starts to turn brown.</li>
<li>Add in hard vegetables. If using cabbage, save that for last. Cook until veggies soften.</li>
<li>If non-vegan, scramble fry eggs in separate smaller pan until no longer runny, then add to stir fry.</li>
<li>Once eggs are firm/brown to liking, add cabbage. Cabbage softens fast, so saving it for last lets it retain some crunch.</li>
<li>Once cabbage softens, remove wok from heat. Serve on a plate with favorite sides.</li>
</ol>
