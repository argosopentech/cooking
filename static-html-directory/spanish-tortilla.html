<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>8 free-range eggs</li>
<li>1 kg of potatoes</li>
<li>1 white onion</li>
<li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Peel, rinse and dry the potatoes.</li>
<li>Cut the potatoes into thin slices. Put in a bowl, add salt to taste and stir.</li>
<li>Put a nonstick frying pan on the fire and add enough olive oil to fry all the potato slices.</li>
<li>Add the potato slices already salted and let them cook for approximately 20 minutes over low heat.</li>
<li>While the potatoes are frying, beat the eggs in a bowl. Peel and cut the onion as finely as possible.</li>
<li>Add olive oil in another frying pan and slowly fry the onion until it gets a slightly golden color.</li>
<li>Drain the onion and add it to the bowl with the beaten egg.</li>
<li>Remove the potatoes from the pan with a slotted spoon, draining the oil away as much as possible, and add them to the bowl with the onion and egg.</li>
<li>Let the mixture rest for at least 5 minutes so all the flavors come together. Give it a very gentle stir from time to time.</li>
<li>Remove the oil from the pan you used to fry the potatoes. Use the pan to cook the mixture over medium-high fire for about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Flip it over with the help of a big plate and cook the other side for another 5 minutes.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Things like the slicing of the potato, the amount of salt and how curdled is the inner part of the tortilla depend on your own taste. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to experiment!</li>
