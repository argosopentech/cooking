<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 lb. of raw pre-shelled peanuts</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Spread peanuts on a large baking sheet and roast in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for ten to twelve minutes</li>
<li>While the peanuts are still hot remove any skins from them. This is best done by wrapping a few handfuls at a time in a dish towel and rolling them against each other for several seconds.</li>
<li>Put all your roasted and skinned peanuts in a food processor, add salt if desired, and chop until you have reached your desired thickness of peanut butter. (This may take a few minutes)</li>
</ol>
