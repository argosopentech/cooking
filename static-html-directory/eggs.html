<p>Eggs are great. This page will contain all sorts of &ldquo;basic&rdquo; ways of having an
egg. Feel free to suggest more, as per the instructions on the
<a href="index.html">homepage</a>.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>eggs</li>
<li>butter</li>
<li>cheese(optional)</li>
<li>milk (optional)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<h3>Boiled eggs</h3>

<ol>
<li>Bring water to boil (about enough to cover the eggs when submerged).</li>
<li>Place eggs in water.</li>
<li>Keep heat high enough to keep a rolling boil, boil until desired consistency
(about 5 or less minutes for soft boiled and very runny, 8 minutes for medium
runny, 10+ for hard boiled).</li>
</ol>


<p>Tip: if your eggs are cracking when you put them in boiling water, you might
improve your chances of them not doing so by first warming them up in warm water
for a few minutes beforehand.</p>

<h3>Sunny-side up</h3>

<ol>
<li>Heat up butter or oil on small pan.</li>
<li>Crack egg(s) into pan.</li>
<li>Cook on low heat for an evenly cooked white and runny yolk.</li>
<li>Serve seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Scrambled</h3>

<ol>
<li>Heat up butter or oil on pan.</li>
<li>Crack eggs into pan.</li>
<li>Start scrambling with wooden spatula.</li>
<li>Cook until desired dryness.</li>
<li>Season with salt and pepper.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Scrambled and fluffy</h3>

<ol>
<li>Prepare as normal.</li>
<li>Crack eggs into pan and let them coagulate maybe twenty or thirty seconds before scrambling.</li>
<li>Use a rubber spatula to sort of scrape the egg towards the center of the pan.
You&rsquo;re pushing the cooked egg towards the center while letting the raw egg spill out to be cooked.
Give the egg a couple seconds to cook before pushing it back towards the center.
The more you scramble the less fluffy the egg will be.</li>
<li>Finish as normal.</li>
</ol>


<p>Scrambled eggs are easy to customize. E.g. start by frying any of: onions, bits
of ham, mushrooms, chopped tomatoes, etc., before cracking the eggs in.</p>
