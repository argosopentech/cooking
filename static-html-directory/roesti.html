<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>~800g (~1.5lb) potatoes (firm/waxy)</li>
<li>2 carrots</li>
<li>500g (~1lb) peas or spinach</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>2 onion (medium size)</li>
<li>butter</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t have cooked potatoes from the day before: Cook them and let them cool. It is important to use cold potatoes. You can also use raw potatoes. The cooking time will increase though.</li>
<li>Shred your potatoes with a grater. The shreds should be quite large so don&rsquo;t use your typical cheese shredder.</li>
<li>Dice the first onion and mix together with potatoes. You can also add diced bacon if you want to. Add your seasonings here.</li>
<li>Heat up some butter in a large pan. Add your mix to the pan on high heat. Let the mixture get warm for a few minutes under constant stirring.</li>
<li>Reduce heat to medium-high. Form the R√∂sti into a round puck. It should fill out the whole pan. I recommend a thickness of around 1 - 1.5cm (~&frac12;") for a softer R√∂sti.</li>
<li>Add some more butter flakes around the inside of the pan to get it under the R√∂sti.</li>
<li>It can take quite a while for a nice crust to form. Check after roughly 5-10 minutes for browning.</li>
<li>While the R√∂sti is cooking dice the other onion and the carrots. Steam everything in a pan with a bit of water. Use a lid to get the temperature up.</li>
<li>Alternatively you can use fresh or creamed spinach.</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re satisfied with the browning, flip the R√∂sti and set the heat to medium-low. A plate can be useful here to put on top of the R√∂sti in the pan.</li>
<li>When the R√∂sti crispness is to your liking, remove from pan and fry two eggs. A runny yolk adds quite a bit to the potatoes.</li>
<li>Top R√∂sti with eggs and serve with the peas or spinach.</li>
</ol>
