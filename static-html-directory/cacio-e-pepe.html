<p>Cacio e Pepe (meaning cheese and pepper) is not only based but also incredibly simple, ideal for lazy neets and similarly minded people who don&rsquo;t want to wash too many dishes and don&rsquo;t like complicated recipes with too many extra ingredients.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>Spaghetti</li>
<li>Grated Pecorino Romano</li>
<li>Peppercorns (you can also use pepper but it will change the flavour)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Cook your chosen amount of spaghetti 3-4 minutes under the time on the package
according to the directions on the package or however you usually do it. See <a href="pasta.html">Pasta</a>.</li>
<li>Meanwhile place the peppercorns on a cutting board and mash them with a pestle.</li>
<li>Place half of the peppercorns in a pan and toast them at medium heat.</li>
<li>Drain the pasta, place it in the pan and save the boiling water for later use.</li>
<li>Add the pasta with the pepper with 2 spoons of the water previously saved.</li>
<li>Prepare the Pecorino by putting half of it a bowl with a spoon of the pasta water you saved; continue mixing the cheese with the water until a cream is formed.</li>
<li>When the pasta is almost cooked, add the cream and mix (you can add more water if the pasta is too dry).</li>
<li>Serve on a plate with the Pecorino left before on top.</li>
</ol>
