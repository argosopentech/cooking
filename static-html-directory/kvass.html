<ul>
<li>⏲️ Prep time: ~30 min</li>
<li>⌛ Fermentation time: ~1 week</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>100 g of raisins</li>
<li>100 g of sugar</li>
<li>3 slices of black bread (e.g. pumpernickel bread, rye bread)</li>
<li>1-2 lemons</li>
<li>1 pkg (7 g) of active dry yeast</li>
<li><em>Optional:</em>

<ul>
<li><em>A handful of coffee beans</em></li>
<li><em>Non-citrus fruits (e.g. plums, apples, kiwi)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Bring 1 L of water in a pot to a boil.</li>
<li>Burn black bread in a toaster or in an oven until it is thoroughly scorched to blackness on the outside.</li>
<li>Once the water has come to boil, remove off heat. Add burned black bread, a handful of raisins, a few slices of lemon, and coffee beans to the pot.</li>
<li>Leave contents of the pot to cool down to room temperature.</li>
<li>Filter out everything from the pot through a strainer, and pour contents into a separate, sterilized container. Add sugar and yeast into
the container, and stir until sugar is dissolved. This starts the fermentation process. The amount of sugar in this recipe should yield 1.0%-2.5% alcohol
by total volume at the end of the fermentation process.</li>
<li>Add rest of raisins, and non-citrus fruits of your choice. The fruits will positively impact flavour of the final product.</li>
<li>If mixture is not already in a mason jar, pour the mixture into a sterile mason jar, and seal the lid. Place the jar in a warm place (26-30°C; 79-86°F),
and let it ferment for a week, or until it stops bubbling.</li>
<li>Remove all raisins and fruits from the jar.</li>
<li>Squeeze lemon juice from lemons into the mixture. You may drink the now-complete kvass right away, or refrigerate it before drinking.</li>
</ol>
