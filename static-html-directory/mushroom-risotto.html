<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>1 shallot</li>
<li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
<li>300g button or crimini mushrooms</li>
<li>400g risotto rice (Arborio, Carnaroli or Vialone Nano)</li>
<li>&frac12; cup white wine (optional)</li>
<li>Mushroom or chicken stock</li>
<li>Butter</li>
<li>Grated Pecorino or Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Finely mince the shallot and garlic and slice the mushrooms into large pieces.</li>
<li>Heat a pan with some olive oil on medium-high heat. Ideally this should be a wide skillet with tall sides, but a pot will also do the job.</li>
<li>Saute the vegetables until fragrant, then add the mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook them down until they&rsquo;re nicely browned, about 10 minutes or so.</li>
<li>Add the rice in and let it toast for about a minute or so. This will develop some nice nutty flavors, but overdoing this will affect the creaminess of the finished dish.</li>
<li>Deglaze with white wine and let the alcohol cook off. After that start ladling in the stock bit by bit stirring constantly for about 20-30 minutes (depending on the brand of rice used), until the rice is cooked but has a slight bite to it.</li>
<li>Turn off the heat and add a couple tablespoons of cold butter and grated cheese, and stir well to emulsify. Check for final seasoning and serve.</li>
</ol>
