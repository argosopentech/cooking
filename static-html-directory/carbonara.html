<p>Carbonara is a simple dish. The quality of your ingredients make or break it.
I recommend using the best ingredients you can source.
Suggestions: bronze extruded pasta, 24 months aged Parmigiano-Reggiano, 12+ months aged Pecorino Romano, guanciale from the butcher, and organic eggs.</p>

<p>This recipe assumes medium eggs.</p>

</ul>


<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>Spaghetti: 320 g | 11 oz</li>
<li>Eggs: 5</li>
<li>Guanciale or Smoked Pancetta (cleaned and cubed): 150 g | 5 oz</li>
<li>Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano (grated)(optional)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Crack the eggs in a bowl but only add the yolks. Add a generous amount of your preferred grated cheese (Pecorino or Parmigiano) around 35g (you can optionally add a dash of black pepper).</li>
<li>Fill a pot with water, and when it boils cook the pasta 1 minute less than advised. Use less salt than you would normally too. (see <a href="pasta.html">Pasta</a>)</li>
<li>Fry the preferred pork (Guanciale or Smoked Pancetta) in a iron or nonstick pan (if using a different kind of pan add a dash of extra virgin olive oil) on low to medium heat until the sides are crisp but the insides are chewy.</li>
<li>While everything is being cooked and fried, beat the eggs manually using a fork until everything is entirely liquid. Remember to watch the time.</li>
<li>When your pasta is done (-1 minute), drain it and put it in the bowl with eggs. At this step you may consider the timing: if the pasta is too hot you will cook the eggs, and some people don&rsquo;t like it this way, so just wait for a minute. Keep moving and stirring to fully incorporate the eggs. Add guanciale and as many fats remaining in the pan as you want. Keep moving and stirring.</li>
<li>Plate and optionally garnish with the preferred grated cheese and black pepper. Voila.</li>
</ol>
