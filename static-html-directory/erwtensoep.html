<p>Erwtensoep, also called snert, is the Dutch version of pea soup.
Slices of rookworst (smoked sausage) are added before serving. The soup, which is traditionally eaten during the winter, is emblematic of Dutch cuisine.
It is customarily served with Frisian rye bread (roggebrood) and bacon, cheese or butter.
Pancakes are sometimes served with pea soup; this dish is called snert met struif, struif referring to the pancakes.</p>
